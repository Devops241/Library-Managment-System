Library management System (LMS)
This Github is created for a project to create a library managmenet system and was committed in Jan-Feb 2024.

The library management for town HD in country HP is currently done manually via excel records
maintenance that requires extensive human resources in each step and is prone to errors and
creates challenges for both librarians and users to borrow books and records keeping. There is
also a changing and evolving requirement for a solution that includes the e-book offering to the
users as residents of town HD, especially increasing demand of young citizens in the age group
of 13-40. The situation brings up the urgent need for a complex web application for the library
system using Agile method that would help the Town Council to have the effective and adaptive
solutions for its residents with the population of 20,000 users including 50% active users for
e-books.
Proposed web app:
The proposed LMS web app will automate the function of checking availability of books,
borrowing the books because the current manual record keeping requires more people doing
the work. The features of the website will include:
- Manage users by username and password with corresponding quota for both physical
books and e-books
- Provide the search function for books by title, author and other metadata including years
of publishing, publisher,...
- Provide results for the booksâ€™ availability and return the location and the borrowing code
of the book from the search
- Provide the function for users to renew the borrowed book online
- Provide the function for users to manage their profile and books on loans online
- Provide the function for users to be able to reserve e-book or hard-copy book
- Send alerts to users via email/message when their books are due in 1 week
- Users could view their loan history
- Provide function for users to pay for late payment charge, reservation fee, membership
fee online
